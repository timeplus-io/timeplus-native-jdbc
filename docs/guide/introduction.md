## JDBC Driver

### Differences from Timeplus [proton-jdbc-driver](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton-jdbc-driver)

* Data is organized and compressed by columns.
* Implemented in the TCP Protocol, with higher performance than HTTP, here is the [benchmark report](../dev/benchmark.md).

### Limitations

* Not support insert complex values expression, like `INSERT INTO test_table VALUES(to_date(123456))`, but query is ok.
* Not support insert non-values format, like `TSV`.
* Not support more compression method, like `ZSTD`.
